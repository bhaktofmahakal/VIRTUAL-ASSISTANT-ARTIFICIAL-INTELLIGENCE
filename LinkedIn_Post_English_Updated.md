- **Weather Updates**: Temperature, humidity, and weather conditions for any city using OpenWeatherMap API
- **News Service**: Topic-based latest news updates from NewsAPI
- **Screenshot Capability**: Easily capture screenshots with voice commands
- **Voice Notes**: Create and save notes using voice input
- **System Monitoring**: Track CPU and RAM usage in real-time
- **Web Browsing**: Open websites and perform web searches with voice commands
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple menu to choose between Hindi and English versions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This project leverages the following technologies:
- **Python**: Core programming language with both Hindi and English implementations
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: High-quality text-to-speech conversion for natural voice output
- **pygame**: Audio playback for smooth voice responses
- **SpeechRecognition**: Voice recognition in both Hindi and English using Google's speech recognition API

- **webbrowser**: Web browsing and search capabilities

## üí° Inspiration & Learning

The primary goal of this project was to create an AI assistant that's accessible to both English and Hindi speakers. Programming in multiple languages presented unique technical challenges and helped me appreciate the importance of language and cultural context in technology. This project demonstrates how AI assistants can be made more accessible to non-English speakers while maintaining full functionality for English users as well.

## üåü Key Improvements in the Latest Version

- **Bilingual Support**: Added complete English language support alongside Hindi
- **Better Voice Quality**: Upgraded from pyttsx3 to Google's Text-to-Speech for more natural voice
- **Web Integration**: Added web browsing and search capabilities
- **Improved User Experience**: Created a language selection menu for easy switching
- **Better File Management**: Implemented temporary file handling for audio files
- **Simplified Installation**: Added batch files for easy setup and dependency installation

## üîÆ Future Development

Future plans include:
- Support for additional Indian languages
- Enhanced natural language understanding with machine learning
- IoT integration for smart home control
- Mobile application development
- Integration with local services and applications
- Offline mode for voice recognition and synthesis
